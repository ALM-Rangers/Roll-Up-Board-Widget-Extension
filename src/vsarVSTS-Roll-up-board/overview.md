5. Click on the widget to take you to the associated board. 

### Known issue(s)
There is an oddity that occurs when a work item appears on several boards and has overlapping area path ownership between two or more teams. Itâ€™s a known limitation of Query on the Kanban board today and we therefore do **not** support overlapping area paths.
